\begin{abstract}
The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is also a neutrino source. The Duke Neutrino Group has built a detector prototype to observe coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CENNS), a process that has been predicted but never observed so far. Beforehand, the detector was simulated with the MCNP-Polimi framework and the goal of this paper is to reproduce the results with Geant4.
\end{abstract}
\newpage

\section{Simulation setup}

The Geant4 simulation toolkit was used to reproduce the results of \#paper\#. The detector setup can be seen in figure \ref{fig:detector}. The detector's core consists of a lead cube (\SI{50}{cm} edge-length) with 4 holes that hold one EJ-301 scintillator, each. These are frustums of a cone and are made of pure liquid EJ-301 (\cf{C_8H_{10}}). The sides and the bottom of the lead cube are covered with a \SI{1}{cm} thick layer of EJ-200 a solid plastic scintillator (\cf{C_{10}H_{11}}]). Above the lead cube is a gap of \SI{21}{cm} followed by an Al-7075 plate with a thickness of \SI{2}{cm}. This plate shall reduce signals of cosmic neutrinos in the real detector. The whole setup is enclosed by a \SI{1}{m^3} water cube.

	\label{fig:detector}
\end{figure}

Neutrons are being generated only inside the lead at a random position with a random direction.

If a particle enters one of the scintillators and deposits energy, that amount will be converted into electron-equivalent energy by using the graph in figure \ref{fig:photonResponse}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./pics/scintillatorResponse.pdf}
	\caption{Photon response of the EJ-301 scintillator.}
	\label{fig:photonResponse}
\end{figure}
In addition to the four particles mentioned in this graph there is also a number of $\gamma$, $e^+$ and deuterons that enter the scintillator. Since $e^+$ have the same mass and charge as $e^-$ and $\gamma$ will decay into $e^- + e^+$, both are treated as electrons. Deuterons will approximately emit a number of photons that lies in the middle between $p$ and $\alpha$. 

Also, in approx. 0.5\% of the events the reaction 
\begin{align}
	\ce{n^1_0 + C^{12}_6 -> C^{13}_6 -> B^9_4 + \alpha^4_2 } 
\end{align}
can occur. The electron-equivalent energy of the beryllium nucleus will not be calculated because this effect should be negligible.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Correct set up}

First of all, it was necessary to verify that the neutrons were generated in the correct volume. Figure \ref{} and \ref{} show that the particles were generated only inside the lead and not inside the holes which contain the scintillators. Figure \ref{} and \ref{} show that the direction of the neutrons is equally distributed.


\subsection{Efficiency}

An event will be marked as "valid" once the energy deposition in a single scintillator exceeds a given threshold in keVee.  Figure \ref{fig:efficiency30} and \ref{fig:efficiency100} show the percentage of how many events were marked as "valid" at a given energy of the primary particle. Two different thresholds \SI{30}{keVee} and \SI{100}{keVee} were used.

 \begin{figure}[H]
 	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.49\textwidth}

 	\end{subfigure}
 	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.49\textwidth}
 		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/efficiencyComplete100.pdf}
 		\caption{100 keVee threshold}
 	\end{subfigure}
 	\caption{Percentage of "valid" events for given monochromatic primary particles with a given threshold. MCNP results of "two scintillators" were not included, they varied between 0-1\%.}
 	\label{fig:efficiency30}
 \end{figure}
 
 It has to be noted that \label{part:eResponse} the MCNP code did not use figure \ref{fig:photonResponse} to convert the deposited energy to keVee. Instead it was assumed that the scintillator response of a proton is about $\sfrac{1}{10}$\hspace{2pt}th and of a carbon \sfrac{1}{100}\hspace{2pt}th that of an electron. This approximation is valid for low energies but at $\sim\SI{0.7}{MeV}$ the proton response of protons rises. 
 Figures \ref{fig_primaryEnergies}a/b show that most neutrons have energies $>\SI{1}{MeV}$. Therefore the non-linear part might not be negligible.
  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.4\textwidth}
  		\centering
  		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./pics/primaryEnergy_orig.jpg}
  		\caption{MCNP}
  		\label{fig:primaryEnergyMCNP}
  	\end{subfigure}
  	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.55\textwidth}
  		\centering
  		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./pics/primaryEnergy.jpg}
  		\caption{Geant4}
  		\label{fig:primaryEnergyGeant4}
  	\end{subfigure}
  	\caption{Energy distribution of the primary neutrons. A \SI{5}{MeV} cutoff was used in both programs. To emulate a distribution like  \ref{fig:primaryEnergyMCNP}, 10 data points were read by a digitizer. This results in the sharp edges in \ref{fig:primaryEnergyGeant4}.}
  	\label{fig_primaryEnergies}
  \end{figure}
  
 The efficiency of the Geant4 simulation is about 5\% higher. This might be a result of the superior tracking algorithms of Geant which will also track secondaries, whereas the MCNP simulation was run in neutron and photon mode only \ref{}. 
 
 Also, the scintillators were simulated as frustums of a cone instead as frustums of a hexagonal pyramid. This increases the cross-sectional area of each scintillator slightly and might result in more valid events.   
 
\subsection{Timing}

Figure \ref{fig:timing30} and \ref{fig:timing100} show a distribution of the arrival time of a signal. The neutron is being generated at $t=\SI{0}{ns}$ and a signal arrives once the energy deposition one scintillator exceeds a given threshold (\SI{30}{keVee} or \SI{100}{keVee}) for the first time.
 \begin{figure}[H]
 	     \includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 1.1cm, clip, width=\textwidth]{pics/timing.pdf}
 	\caption{Black: MCNP, blue: Geant4. Threshold is \SI{30}{keVee}. Both histograms are not normalized.}
 	\label{fig:timing30}
 \end{figure}

The timing graphs of both, Geant4 and MCNP simulation, show a dropoff at \SI{0}{ns} due to the threshold and end somewhere between \SI{100}{ns} and \SI{140}{ns}.  

\subsection{Energy deposition}

Finally, the energy depositions of both simulations are being compared. Figure \ref{fig:photonResponse} provided the necessary data to convert the energy to electron equivalent (keVee). As mentioned before, $\gamma$ and $e^+$ are treated as $e^-$ and deuterons lie in the middle between $p$ and $\alpha$. Seldom particles like beryllium will be ignored.

Figure \ref{fig:edepFull} and \ref{fig:edepSmall} show the normalized count of valid events on a 60 day exposure. The blue curve uses the same photon response values as the MCNP code which was explained in paragraph \ref{part:eResponse}. The results of the MCNP simulation should look similar, but data was only available from 0-600 keVee (see black curve in fig. \ref{fig:edepSmall}). 
The red curve uses the photon response of fig \ref{fig:photonResponse} and is expected to be closer to the  data of the real detector. Both curves however, show a peak at 2.2 MeVee which is a result of neutron capture at hydrogen.
The green curve uses the same settings as the red one but a cutoff was applied after \SI{5}{$\mu$ s}. This removes almost all 2.2 MeVee neutron capture $\gamma$.

 \begin{figure}[H]
 	\centering
 		\includegraphics[width=1.\textwidth]{pics/edep_full.pdf}
 		\caption{Energy deposition of different energy settings in with Geant4. Blue curve uses the same settings as MCNP simulation and should resemble its results at energies > \SI{600}{keVee}.}
 		\label{fig:edepFull}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
 		\includegraphics[width=1.\textwidth]{pics/edep_small.pdf}
 		\caption{Close up of figure \ref{fig:edepFull}. The black curve is the original data of the MCNP simulation that was only available from {0-600} {keVee}.}
 		\label{fig:edepSmall}
 	\end{figure} 
 	
 Figure \ref{fig:edepSmall} shows a closeup of figure \ref{fig:edepFull} from 0-600 keVee. The blue curve has the same slope as the original data (black) but there is a small offset in the beginning.
 The red and the green curve stay close together and even match the original data from 1-200 keVee better than the blue curve does but after that they ++++++++++ from the original data.
 
 As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:edepFull} the blue curve shows a sharper drop off between 0.2 and 1.4 MeV than the red curve due to the linear energy deposition. Both curves have a peak at \SI{2.2}{MeVee} which is a result of neutron capture at hydrogen. This process emits a \SI{2.2}{MeVee} $\gamma$, that will deposit all of its energy in most events.
 
The only difference between the red and the green
